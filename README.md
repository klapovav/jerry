# Jerry
Jerry is a software program that enables users to control multiple computers with a single mouse and keyboard, thus eliminating the need to switch between keyboards and mice when working across multiple computers connected to the same network.

 The program comprises a control application for Windows OS and a client application compatible with Windows, Linux (X11), and macOS systems.

A significant advantage of this software, as opposed to the others, lies in its accurate key press interpretation, independent of the controlling computerâ€™s current state, keyboard layout, or mapping. It ensures error-free typing of accented characters, operates without compromising system responsiveness, and imposes no limitations on virtual desktop configuration.

Features:
- [x] sharing the text clipboard
- [x] encryption
